  "storyline": "In Greek mythology, Pandora was the very first mortal woman, created by the gods at Zeus’s command using clay. Zeus initiated this creation as a form of punishment for humanity, retaliating against Prometheus for stealing fire and giving it to mankind. Known as \"the all-gifted one\" because of her extraordinary endowments, Pandora was both beautiful and cunning. Zeus bestowed upon her a mysterious box and arranged her marriage to Epimetheus, the brother of Prometheus.\n\nDespite being warned never to open the box, Pandora's insatiable curiosity ultimately got the better of her. When she finally lifted the lid, all manner of calamities—disasters, diseases, wars, and various evils—spilled out into the world, spreading chaos among humankind. However, amid all the unleashed woes, hope remained trapped inside the box, as Pandora quickly shut it before it could escape. This tale has since become a powerful symbol of how, even in the midst of overwhelming misfortune, hope endures.",
