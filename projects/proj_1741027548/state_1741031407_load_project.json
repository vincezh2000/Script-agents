  "editor_advice": "1. **Character Depth and Complexity:** The characters have a solid foundation, but could benefit from added depth. Provide Liang Wei with a personal stake or past trauma related to privacy breaches to deepen his internal conflict. This could involve a personal memory being exploited in the past, enhancing the moral and emotional weight of his dilemma.\n\n2. **Character Relationships:** The relationships between characters could be further developed to enhance engagement. For instance, explore a more complex dynamic between Liang and Aria where mutual growth is inspired by their interactions—possibly having them challenge each other's worldviews more directly. Additionally, consider a subplot where Maya and Thomas have differing opinions on the media's role in the privacy debate, creating tension that evolves into mutual respect.\n\n3. **Arcs and Motivations:** Ensure the characters have clear and evolving motivations. Aria’s transition from antagonist to ally could be more nuanced by showing specific events or revelations that trigger her change. Illustrate how Thomas Quinn's weariness manifests—does it result in cynicism or fuel his determination? Maya Torres’ motivations could be rounded out by a subplot involving a personal connection to someone who was harmed by a privacy breach, thereby intensifying her drive.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** While the characters' roles align well with the storyline, ensure consistency by incorporating background details—such as Liang's qualifications and employment background leading to the discovery. This reinforces believability within the futuristic setting.\n\n5. **Captivating Character Traits:** Integrate distinctive quirks or habits for each character that align with their roles and personalities, making them more memorable. For instance, give Liang a particular routine or mannerism when problem-solving that highlights his methodical nature.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the characters will not only integrate more seamlessly with the storyline but also captivate the audience through relatable conflicts and rich interpersonal dynamics.",
